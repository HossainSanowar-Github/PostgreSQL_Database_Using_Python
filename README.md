# PostgreSQL_Database_Using_Python

This Python PostgreSQL tutorial shows how to connect to PostgreSQL and run SQL queries and database operations using the Psycopg2 module. We may connect to a PostgreSQL database in Python in a variety of methods, and in this lesson, we'll look at a few of them.

The following is a collection of Python modules that may be used with PostgreSQL.

1. Psycopg2
2. pg8000
3. py-postgresql
4. PyGreSQL
5. ocpgdb
6. bpgsql
7. SQLAlchemy. SQLAlchemy needs any of the above to be installed separately.

This Python PostgreSQL tutorial mostly covers the following topics.

1. Psycopg2 is installed, and its API is used to access the PostgreSQL database.
2. Data insertion, retrieval, update, and deletion are all possible with the Python program.
3. Following that, it will go through PostgreSQL transaction management, connection pooling, and error-handling strategies for developing PostgreSQL-based Python programs.
